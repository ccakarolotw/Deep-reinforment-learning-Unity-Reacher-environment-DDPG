# Deep-reinforment-learning-Unity-Reacher-environment-DDPG
This project uses DDPG implemented in Pytorch to solve the Unity Reacher environment.

## Unity Reacher Environment
The agent controls a double-jointed arm to move to goal locations and keep it there. The agent recieve +0.1 reward for every time stamp the arm is in the goal location. The observation space has 33 variables and the action space has 4 continuous variables.
